### About Me

My name is Mohamed Tarek Mohamed, or simply Mohamed. I am a PhD student in computer science at UNSW Canberra, Australia. My research interests include using optimization theory for mechanical design. In this blog, I will talk about a few science topics that interest me in computational mathematics, optimization theory, programming, mechanical design and much more. Stay tuned!

### My life

I was born in 1994 and let me tell you, I have been around quite a few countries! I am originally from Egypt where I lived for a good 11 years finishing the primary school there. After that, my family moved to Saudi Arabia for my dad's work where I completed my middle and high school. I then joined Alfaisal University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, where I did a Bachelor degree in Mechanical engineering, my first love! During the Bachelor degree, I learnt about research for the first time, and overall it was a very academically and socially enriching experience for me, where I learnt a lot and met a lot of awesome people while I was involved in various student activities.

After my Bachelor degree, I was blessed enough to get a scholarship to do a Master degree in Industrial and Systems Engineering at the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), Daejeon, South Korea which is one of the best universities in South Korea. During my Master degree, I learnt about optimization theory and machine learning for the first time, and I was captivated! Even since, optimization theory has been my love together with mechanical engineering ;)

Currently in my PhD, I am even more blessed to be working in the 2 areas I love the most in science: 1) mechanical engineering, and 2) optimization theory.
