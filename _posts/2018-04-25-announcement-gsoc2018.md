I have been accepted in this year's Google Summer of Code with the NumFOCUS organisation where I will be using the Julia programming language to complete an open source project. The project is simply about coding up a generalized eigenvalue solver to solve problems of the form:

<p style="text-align: center;"> ![Generalized eigenvalue equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cmathbf%7BA%7D%20%5Cmathbf%7Bx%7D%20%3D%20%5Clambda%20%5Cmathbf%7BB%7D%20%5Cmathbf%7Bx%7D) </p>

I will implement the locally optimal block preconditioned conjugate gradient (LOBPCG) method together with a variety of preconditioners. Stay tuned for more related blogs!
